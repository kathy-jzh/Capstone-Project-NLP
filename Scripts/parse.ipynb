(c) For  each  Collection  Period  and  as  of  any  date  of  determination,  the Scheduled  Distribution  on  any  Pledged  Obligation  (other  than  a  Defaulted  Obligation,  which, except as otherwise provided herein, shall be assumed to have a Scheduled Distribution of zero) shall be the sum of (i) the total amount of payments and collections to be received during such Collection Period in respect of such Pledged Obligation (including the proceeds of the sale of such  Pledged  Obligation  received  and,  in  the  case  of  sales  which  have  not  yet  settled,  to  be received during the Collection Period and not reinvested in additional Collateral Obligations or Eligible Investments or retained in the Collection Account for subsequent reinvestment pursuant to  Section 12.2) that, if paid as scheduled, shall be available in the Collection Account at the end of  the  Collection  Period  and  (ii)  any  such  amounts  received  by  the  Issuer  in  prior  Collection Periods that were not disbursed on a previous Distribution Date. Each  Scheduled  Distribution  receivable  with  respect  to  a  Pledged Obligation shall be assumed to be received on the applicable Due Date, and each such Scheduled (d) 758924-4-479-v17.0  - 3 - 80-40587115 \\x0c Distribution  shall  be  assumed  to  be  immediately  deposited  in  the  Collection  Account  to  earn interest at the Assumed Reinvestment Rate.  All such funds shall be assumed to continue to earn interest until the date on which they are required to be available in the Collection Account for application, in accordance with the terms hereof, to payments of principal of or interest on the Notes  or  other  amounts  payable  pursuant  to  this  Indenture.    For  the  avoidance  of  doubt,  all amounts calculated pursuant to this  Section 1.2(d) are estimates and may differ from the actual amounts  available  to  make  distributions  hereunder,  and  no  party  shall  have  any  obligation  to make any payment hereunder due to the assumed amounts calculated under this  Section 1.2(d) being greater than the actual amounts available.  For purposes of the applicable determinations required  by   Section 10.7(b)(iv),   the  Coverage  Tests  and  the  Collateral  Quality  Tests,  the expected interest on Secured Notes and floating rate Collateral Obligations shall be calculated using the then current interest rates applicable thereto. (e) For purposes of the definition of Moody\\'s Additional Current Pay Criteria, with respect to a Collateral Obligation already owned by the Issuer whose facility rating from Moody\\'s is withdrawn, the facility rating shall be the last outstanding facility rating before such withdrawal. (f) the  Priority  of Distributions will give effect to all payments that precede (in priority of payment) or include the clause of the Priority of Distributions in which such calculation is made. Calculations  of  amounts to  be  distributed  under (g) For purposes of calculating the Moody\\'s Weighted Average Rating Factor, any Collateral Obligation that is a Current Pay Obligation, a Defaulted Obligation or a Deferring Obligation shall be excluded. (h) Except as otherwise provided herein, Defaulted Obligations and Deferring Obligations shall not be included in the calculation of the Collateral Quality Test. (i) Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, for purposes of calculating all Concentration Limitations, in both the numerator and the denominator of any component of the Concentration Limitations, Defaulted Obligations shall be held at their Principal Balance. (j) For  purposes  of  calculating  compliance  with  the  Investment  Criteria  or Post-Reinvestment Period Criteria, as applicable, upon the direction of the Portfolio Manager by notice  to  the  Trustee  and  the  Collateral  Administrator,  any  Eligible  Investment  representing Principal Proceeds received upon the maturity, redemption, sale or other disposition of Collateral Obligations  shall  be  deemed  to  have  the  characteristics  of  such  Collateral  Obligations  until reinvested  in  additional  Collateral  Obligations.    Such  calculations  shall  be  based  upon  the principal amount of such Collateral Obligations, except in the case of Defaulted Obligations and Credit  Risk  Obligations,  in  which  case  the  calculations  shall  be  based  upon  the  Principal Proceeds  received  on  the  disposition  or  sale  of  such  Defaulted  Obligations  or  Credit  Risk Obligations. (k) For purposes of calculating the Sale Proceeds of a Collateral Obligation in sale transactions, Sale Proceeds shall include any Principal Financed Accrued Interest received in respect of such sale. 758924-4-479-v17.0  - 4 - 80-40587115 \\x0c (l) For  purposes  of  calculating  the  Concentration  Limitations,  without duplication, (i) Bridge Loans will not be considered Senior Secured Loans and (ii) the amounts on deposit in the Collection Account and the Ramp-Up Account (including Eligible Investments therein)  representing  Principal  Proceeds  shall  each  be  deemed  to  be  a  floating  rate  Collateral Obligation that is a Senior Secured Loan. (m)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture to the contrary, all monetary calculations under this Indenture shall be in U.S. Dollars. (n) Unless  otherwise  specified,  any  reference  to  the  fees  payable  under   the Priority of Distributions or to an amount calculated with respect to a period at per annum rate shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.  Any fees applicable to periods shorter than or longer than a calendar quarter shall be prorated to the actual number of days within such period. (o) Unless otherwise specified, test calculations that evaluate to a percentage shall  be  rounded  to  the nearest  ten-thousandth  and  test  calculations  that  evaluate  to  a  number shall be rounded to the nearest one-hundredth. (p) Unless  otherwise  specifically  provided  herein,  all  calculations  or determinations  required  to  be  made  and  all  reports  which  are  to  be  prepared  pursuant  to  this Indenture shall be made on the basis of the trade date unless the Issuer or the Portfolio Manager on behalf of the Issuer notifies the Trustee in writing, on or prior to the Determination Date, that such  calculations  or  determinations,  as  the  case  may  be,  shall  be  made  on  the  basis  of  the settlement  date.    With  respect  to  any  commitment  to  purchase  a  Collateral  Obligation  that  is intended to settle upon the termination of a Collateral Obligation of the same Obligor currently owned by the Issuer, the trade date of such Collateral Obligation shall be deemed to be the date of termination of the Collateral Obligation of the same obligor currently owned by the Issuer for the purposes of calculating the Concentration Limitations.  The modifications to this Indenture effective on the Refinancing Date and relating to whether the Issuer is permitted to purchase any Collateral Obligation (including the changes to the definition of Collateral Obligation) will apply only  with  respect  to  Collateral  Obligations  committed  to  be  purchased  on  or  after  the Refinancing Date. (q) Determination  of  the  purchase  price  of  a  Collateral  Obligation  shall  be made independently each time such Collateral Obligation is purchased by the Issuer and pledged to  the  Trustee,  without  giving  effect  to  whether  the  Issuer  has  previously  purchased  such Collateral Obligation (or an obligation of the related Obligor). (r)  When used with respect to payments on the Subordinated Notes, the term \"principal  amount\"  shall  mean  amounts  distributable  to  Holders  of  Subordinated  Notes  from Principal Proceeds, and the term \"interest\" shall mean Interest Proceeds distributable to Holders of Subordinated Notes in accordance with the Priority of Distributions. (s) Any references in  Article XI of this Indenture to fees paid to the Portfolio Manager shall not include fees paid to the Portfolio Manager for its role in managing the Assets prior to the Closing Date. 758924-4-479-v17.0  - 5 - 80-40587115 \\x0c (t) Any future anticipated tax liabilities of an Issuer Subsidiary related to an Issuer Subsidiary Asset will be excluded from the calculation of the Weighted Average Floating Spread, the Weighted Average Fixed Coupon and the Interest Coverage Tests. (u) Any reference to LIBOR applicable to any Floating Rate Note as of any Measurement Date during the first Interest Accrual Period shall mean LIBOR for the relevant portion of the first Interest Accrual Period as determined on the preceding Interest Determination Date. (v) If withholding tax is imposed on (i) any amendment, waiver, consent or extension  fees,  (ii)  commitment  fees  or  other  similar  fees  or  fees  that  by  their  nature  are commitment  fees,  or  similar  fees  in  respect  of  Revolving  Collateral  Obligations  and  Delayed Drawdown Collateral Obligations or (iii) any other Collateral Obligation that becomes subject to withholding  tax,  the  calculations  of  the  Weighted  Average  Floating  Spread,  the  Weighted Average Fixed Coupon and the Interest Coverage Test (and all component calculations of such calculations and tests, including when such a component calculation is calculated independently), as applicable, shall be made on a net basis after taking into account such withholding, unless the Obligor is required to make \"gross-up\" payments to the Issuer that cover the full amount of any such withholding tax on an after-tax basis pursuant to the Underlying Instrument with respect thereto. (w)  Any direction or Issuer Order required hereunder relating to the purchase, acquisition,  sale,  disposition  or  other  transfer  of  Assets  may  be  in  the  form  of  a  trade  ticket, confirmation  of  trade,  instruction  to  post  or  to  commit  to  the  trade  or  similar  instrument  or document or other written instruction (including by email or other electronic communication or file transfer protocol) from the Portfolio Manager on which the Trustee may rely.

(ii) Notwithstanding the proviso in clause (i) above, at any time that the Issuer holds Margin Stock with an aggregate Market Value in excess of 10% of the Collateral Principal Amount, the Portfolio Manager shall use commercially reasonable efforts to sell Margin Stock with an aggregate Market Value at least equal to such excess; or (iii) The Portfolio Manager, on behalf of the Issuer, (A) may, on the Closing Date or at the time of purchase, designate certain Collateral Obligations as Subordinated 758924-4-479-v17.0  - 135 - 80-40587115 \\x0c Notes  Collateral  Obligations,  provided  that  the  aggregate  amount  of  Collateral Obligations so designated (measured by the Issuer\\'s acquisition cost (including accrued interest)) shall not exceed the Subordinated Notes Reinvestment Ceiling and (B) shall not, after the Closing Date, purchase any Subordinated Notes Collateral Obligations with any funds  other  than  (a)  funds  in  the  Subordinated  Notes  Ramp-Up  Account  or  the Subordinated  Notes  Principal  Collection  Account,  (b)  Additional  Subordinated  Notes Proceeds  pursuant  to   Section 2.4,  (c)  Contributions  to  the  extent  so  directed  by  the applicable Contributor (or, if the applicable Contributor makes no direction, to the extent so  directed  by  the  Portfolio  Manager)  or  (d)  amounts  in  respect  of  Management  Fees waived  by  the  Portfolio  Manager  in  accordance  with  the  Portfolio  Management Agreement.    If  a  Collateral  Obligation  that  has  not  been  designated  as  a  Subordinated Notes Collateral Obligation becomes Margin Stock or Margin Stock is received by the Issuer  in  respect  of  a  Collateral  Obligation  that  was  not  designated  as  a  Subordinated Notes  Collateral  Obligation  (each,  \"Transferable  Margin  Stock\"),  the  Portfolio Manager, on behalf of the Issuer, may direct the Trustee to (x) transfer one or more non-Margin  Stock  Subordinated  Notes  Collateral  Obligations  having  a  value  equal  to  or greater  than  such  Transferable  Margin  Stock  to  the  Secured  Notes  Collateral  Account, and  simultaneously  (y)  transfer  such  Transferable  Margin  Stock  to  the  Subordinated Notes  Collateral  Account  and  such  Transferable  Margin  Stock  shall  thereafter  be designated  a  Subordinated  Notes  Collateral  Obligation.

After the Reinvestment Period: (i) At the direction and sole discretion of the Portfolio Manager, the Trustee, at  the  expense  of  the  Issuer,  may  (A)  conduct  an  auction  of  Unsalable  Assets  in accordance  with  the  procedures  described  in  clause  (ii)  below  or  (B)  if  the  Portfolio Manager certifies to the Trustee that in its commercially reasonable judgment an auction of  Unsalable  Assets  as  set  forth  in  clause  (A)  would  be  unduly  burdensome  or significantly increase costs to the Issuer and/or the Portfolio Manager, offer to deliver (at no  cost)  the  Unsalable  Asset  to  the  Portfolio  Manager;  provided  that  if  the  Portfolio Manager  declines  such  offer,  the  Trustee  shall  take  such  action  as  directed  by  the Portfolio Manager (on behalf of the Issuer) to dispose of the Unsalable Asset, which may be by donation to a charity, abandonment or other means. (ii) Promptly after receipt of such direction, the Trustee shall provide notice (in such form as is prepared by the Portfolio Manager) to the Holders (and, for so long as any Notes rated by Moody\\'s or Fitch are Outstanding, Moody\\'s or Fitch, as applicable) of an auction, setting forth in reasonable detail a description of each Unsalable Asset and the following auction procedures: (A) any Holder of Notes may submit a written bid to purchase one or more  Unsalable  Assets  no  later  than  the  date  specified  in  the  auction  notice (which shall be at least 15 Business Days after the date of such notice); 758924-4-479-v17.0  - 136 - 80-40587115 \\x0c (B) each bid must include an offer to purchase for a specified amount of Cash on a proposed settlement date no later than 20 Business Days after the date of the auction notice; (C) if  no  Holder  submits  such  a  bid,  unless  delivery  in  kind  is  not legally  or  commercially  practicable,  the  Trustee  shall  provide  notice  thereof  to each Holder and offer to deliver (at no cost) a pro  rata portion of each unsold Unsalable  Asset  to  the  Holders  of  the  most  senior  Class  that  provide  delivery instructions to the Trustee on or before the date specified in such notice, subject to Authorized Denominations.  To the extent that Authorized Denominations do not permit a pro rata distribution, the Portfolio Manager shall identify and the Trustee shall distribute the Unsalable Assets on a pro rata basis to the extent possible and the Trustee shall select by lottery the Holder to whom the remaining amount shall be  delivered.    The  Trustee  shall  use  commercially  reasonable  efforts  to  effect delivery of such interests.  For the avoidance of doubt, any such delivery to the Holders of Notes will not operate to reduce the principal amount of the related Class of Notes held by such Holders; and (D) if no such Holder provides delivery instructions to the Trustee, the Trustee  shall  promptly  notify  the  Portfolio  Manager  and  offer  to  deliver  (at  no cost)  the  Unsalable  Asset  to  the  Portfolio  Manager.    If  the  Portfolio  Manager declines such offer, the Trustee shall take such action as directed by the Portfolio Manager (on behalf of the Issuer) to dispose of the Unsalable Asset, which may be by donation to a charity, abandonment or other means. (i) Volcker  Sales.    In  the  event  that  the  Portfolio  Manager  and  the  Issuer receive an Opinion of Counsel of national reputation that the Issuer\\'s ownership of any specific Collateral Obligation (excluding Senior Secured Loans, but including, for the avoidance of doubt, any  Collateral  Obligations  that  have  been  classified  as  Senior  Secured  Loans  in  error)  would cause  the  Issuer  not  to  be  a  loan  securitization  under  the  Volcker  Rule,  then  the  Portfolio Manager,  on  behalf  of  the  Issuer,  shall  make,  in  a  prompt  manner,  commercially  reasonable efforts to sell such Collateral Obligation and shall not purchase a Collateral Obligation of the type identified in such Opinion of Counsel thereafter. (j) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the Issuer may cause any Issuer Subsidiary Asset or the Issuer\\'s interest therein to be transferred to an Issuer Subsidiary in exchange for an interest in such Issuer Subsidiary.

\\n\\nThe Diversity Score is calculated as follows: \\n\\n(a) \\n\\nAn  “Issuer  Par  Amount”  is  calculated  for  each  issuer  of  a  Collateral \\nObligation,  and  is  equal  to  the  Aggregate  Principal  Balance  of  all  the  Collateral \\nObligations issued by that issuer and all affiliates. \\n\\n(b) \\n\\nAn  “Average  Par  Amount”  is  calculated  by  summing  the  Issuer  Par \\n\\nAmounts for all issuers, and dividing by the number of issuers. \\n\\n(c) \\n\\nAn “Equivalent Unit Score” is calculated for each issuer, and is equal to \\nthe lesser of (x) one and (y) the Issuer Par Amount for such issuer divided by the Average \\nPar Amount. \\n\\n(d) \\n\\nAn “Aggregate Industry Equivalent Unit Score” is then calculated for each \\nof the Moody’s industry classification groups, shown on Schedule 1, and is equal to the \\nsum of the Equivalent Unit Scores for each issuer in such industry classification group. \\n\\n(e) \\n\\nAn  “Industry  Diversity  Score”  is  then  established  for  each  Moody’s \\nindustry classification group, shown on Schedule 1, by reference to the following table \\nfor the related Aggregate Industry Equivalent Unit Score; provided, that if any Aggregate \\nIndustry Equivalent Unit Score falls between any two such scores, the applicable Industry \\nDiversity Score shall be the lower of the two Industry Diversity
