Repayment depends primarily on the project's cash flow and on the collateral value of the project's assets, such as power plants, chemical processing plants, mines, transportation infrastructure, environment, and telecommunications infrastructure.  (2) Object Finance:  a method of funding the acquisition of physical assets (e.g. ships, aircraft, satellites, railcars, and fleets) where the repayment of the exposure is dependent on the cash flows generated by the specific assets that have been financed and pledged or assigned to the lender. A primary source of these cash flows might be rental or lease contracts with one or several third parties. (3) Commodities Finance:  a structured short-term lending to finance reserves, inventories, or receivables of exchange-traded commodities (e.g. crude oil, metals, or crops), where the exposure will be repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the commodity and the borrower has no independent capacity to repay the exposure. This is the case when the borrower has no other activities and no other material assets on its balance sheet. (4) Income-producing real estate:  a method of providing funding to real estate (such as, office buildings to let, retail space, multifamily residential buildings,   -51- industrial or warehouse space, and hotels) where the prospects for repayment and recovery on the exposure depend primarily on the cash flows generated by the asset. The primary source of these cash flows would generally be lease or rental payments or the sale of the asset. (5) High-volatility commercial real estate:  a financing any of the land acquisition, development and construction phases for properties of those types in such jurisdictions, where the source of repayment at origination of the exposure is either the future uncertain sale of the property or cash flows whose source of repayment is substantially uncertain (e.g. the property has not yet been leased to the occupancy rate prevailing in that geographic market for that type of commercial real estate)\"),\n",

Repayment depends primarily on the project's cash flow and on the collateral value of the project's assets, such as power plants, chemical processing plants, mines, transportation infrastructure, environment, and telecommunications infrastructure.  (2) Object Finance:  a method of funding the acquisition of physical assets (e.g. ships, aircraft, satellites, railcars, and fleets) where the repayment of the exposure is dependent on the cash flows generated by the specific assets that have been financed and pledged or assigned to the lender. A primary source of these cash flows might be rental or lease contracts with one or several third parties. (3) Commodities Finance:  a structured short-term lending to finance reserves, inventories, or receivables of exchange-traded commodities (e.g. crude oil, metals, or crops), where the exposure will be repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the commodity and the borrower has no independent capacity to repay the exposure. This is the case when the borrower has no other activities and no other material assets on its balance sheet. (4) Income-producing real estate:  a method of providing funding to real estate (such as, office buildings to let, retail space, multifamily residential buildings,   -51- industrial or warehouse space, and hotels) where the prospects for repayment and recovery on the exposure depend primarily on the cash flows generated by the asset. The primary source of these cash flows would generally be lease or rental payments or the sale of the asset. (5) High-volatility commercial real estate:  a financing any of the land acquisition, development and construction phases for properties of those types in such jurisdictions, where the source of repayment at origination of the exposure is either the future uncertain sale of the property or cash flows whose source of repayment is substantially uncertain (e.g. the property has not yet been leased to the occupancy rate prevailing in that geographic market for that type of commercial real estate)\"),\n",

(b) For purposes of calculating the Coverage Tests and the Interest Diversion Test, except as otherwise specified in the Coverage Tests and the Interest Diversion Test, such calculations shall not include scheduled interest and principal payments on Defaulted Obligations unless or until such payments are actually made. (c) For each Collection Period and as of any date of determination, the Scheduled Distribution on any Pledged Obligation (other than a Defaulted Obligation, which, except as otherwise provided herein, shall be assumed to have a Scheduled Distribution of zero) shall be the sum of (i) the total amount of payments and collections to be received during such Collection Period in respect of such Pledged Obligation (including the proceeds of the sale of such Pledged Obligation received and, in the case of sales which have not yet settled, to be received during the Collection Period and not reinvested in additional Collateral Obligations or Eligible Investments or retained in the Collection Account for subsequent reinvestment pursuant to Section 12.2) that, if paid as scheduled, shall be available in the Collection Account at the end of the Collection Period and (ii) any such amounts received by the Issuer in prior Collection Periods that were not disbursed on a previous Payment Date. (d) Each Scheduled Distribution receivable with respect to a Pledged Obligation shall be assumed to be received on the applicable Due Date, and each such Scheduled Distribution shall be assumed to be immediately deposited in the Collection Account to earn interest at the Assumed Reinvestment Rate.  All such funds shall be assumed to continue to earn interest until the date on which they are required to be available in the Collection Account for application, in accordance with the terms hereof, to payments of principal of or interest on the Notes or other amounts payable pursuant to this Indenture.  For the avoidance of doubt, all amounts calculated pursuant to this Section 1.2(d) are estimates and may differ from the actual amounts available to make distributions hereunder, and no party shall have any obligation to make any payment hereunder due to the assumed amounts calculated under this Section 1.2(d) being greater than the actual amounts available'),\n",

Repayment depends primarily on the project's cash flow and on the collateral value of the project's assets, such as power plants, chemical processing plants, mines, transportation infrastructure, environment, and telecommunications infrastructure.  (2) Object Finance:  a method of funding the acquisition of physical assets (e.g. ships, aircraft, satellites, railcars, and fleets) where the repayment of the exposure is dependent on the cash flows generated by the specific assets that have been financed and pledged or assigned to the lender. A primary source of these cash flows might be rental or lease contracts with one or several third parties. (3) Commodities Finance:  a structured short-term lending to finance reserves, inventories, or receivables of exchange-traded commodities (e.g. crude oil, metals, or crops), where the exposure will be repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the commodity and the borrower has no independent capacity to repay the exposure. This is the case when the borrower has no other activities and no other material assets on its balance sheet.

(a) All calculations with respect to Scheduled Distributions on the Pledged Obligations securing the Secured Notes shall be made on the basis of information as to the terms of each such Pledged Obligation and upon report of payments, if any, received on such Pledged Obligation that are furnished by or on behalf of the Obligor of such Pledged Obligation and, to the extent they are not manifestly in error, such information or report may be conclusively relied upon in making such calculations. (b) For purposes of calculating the Coverage Tests and the Interest Diversion Test, except as otherwise specified in the Coverage Tests and the Interest Diversion Test, such calculations shall not include scheduled interest and principal payments on Defaulted Obligations unless or until such payments are actually made. (c) For each Collection Period and as of any date of determination, the Scheduled Distribution on any Pledged Obligation (other than a Defaulted Obligation, which, except as otherwise provided herein, shall be assumed to have a Scheduled Distribution of zero) shall be the sum of (i) the total amount of payments and collections to be received during such Collection Period in respect of such Pledged Obligation (including the proceeds of the sale of such Pledged Obligation received and, in the case of sales which have not yet settled, to be received during the Collection Period and not reinvested in additional Collateral Obligations or Eligible Investments or retained in the Collection Account for subsequent reinvestment pursuant to Section 12.2) that, if paid as scheduled, shall be available in the Collection Account at the end of the Collection Period and (ii) any such amounts received by the Issuer in prior Collection Periods that were not disbursed on a previous Payment Date. (d) Each Scheduled Distribution receivable with respect to a Pledged Obligation shall be assumed to be received on the applicable Due Date, and each such Scheduled Distribution shall be assumed to be immediately deposited in the Collection Account to earn interest at the Assumed Reinvestment Rate.  All such funds shall be assumed to continue to earn interest until the date on which they are required to be available in the Collection Account for application, in accordance with the terms hereof, to payments of principal of or interest on the Notes or other amounts payable pursuant to this Indenture.  For the avoidance of doubt, all amounts calculated pursuant to this Section 1.2(d) are estimates and may differ from the actual amounts available to make distributions hereunder, and no party shall have any obligation to make any payment hereunder due to the assumed amounts calculated under this Section 1.2(d) being greater than the actual amounts available'}"
